		<h1>THE POETIC DEATH</h1>
	</div>
	<div class="text">
		<p>
			Death, that poetic moment when you repent of all your sins, is the
            moment when everything makes sense and we all believe in a
            merciful being who ignores those sins.
            Death, that unknown line that you cross knowing that you will not be
            able to return.
            People say you can see what a person is like by their parents or their
            eyes, I think you know someone from the people who attend their
            funeral.
            Death is nothing but a relief, a respite from life.
            I believe that there is no person who loves his own life more than
            himself, it is ironic that the only thing that life and death resemble is
            exactly how opposite they are.
            People are usually interested in what happens before or after death
            but I am fascinated by what happens to people while this process
            occurs, I suppose that some would pray that, at moments of death,
            they forgive the sins of their lives , others, in a matter of seconds, will
            see their lives go by, they will remember when they were so young
            that everything was new around them or when they drove for the
            first time thinking they could go to the other side of the world and
            return. In that magical moment, when you realize that nothing you
            have done has been worth anything, you will realize that they will cry
            to you three days a week you will be a good memory and in a month
            no one will remember you, you will only be a piece of rotting meat.
            If you want to avoid that, go out and make them remember you
            forever, try to go down in history or die trying, but at least in those
            last moments before you die you can say that you did more than the
            rest.

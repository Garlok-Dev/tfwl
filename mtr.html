		<h1>MY TOXIC RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD</h1>
	</div>
	<div class="text">
		<p>
			First of all, I want to clarify that I am not referring to a particular god, but to the end of a being with an unlimited power commonly creator of The Earth, I also want to say that I was Catholic so most of what I will say is based, on some points, on the Bible. 

			I've always been fascinated by people's faith toward a being that a "common" person said was your creator, but I find it very simple to explain to SOMEONE about the existence of an all-powerful being. I've heard explanations of all kinds like, "I know there's a god because I have FE..." 

			And there's a thing I knew people don't know its faith. Faith is defined as: "Belief and personal hope in the existence of a higher being." Faith is believing, believing in something you can't prove, but you feel it's true.  

			I honestly don't think the concept of an all-powerful being who loves all his "children" doesn't seem bad to me. As I said at first, I was a Catholic, now I would consider myself a kind of agnostic, which is the belief that there is a being that could have been interfered with in humanity, but without considering it a being with a religion rather a possible alien. I don't think it's a bad concept of an all-powerful being with an ideology of peace and love because that's not god is the distortion of the human being and this can be inferred because, taking into account Genesis and exodus, God banished Adam and Eve from paradise knowing that they would fall into eating the apple of knowledge, God asked them to renounce the flaws that he did not want to remove, he preferred to sentence two people to wander the wilderness for not admitting that he was wrong, and that proves that God is not the perfect being rather is a selfish, self-centred, vengeful little boy, and this either fits that merciful being and father. I can give you another example like when he banished an angel for not agreeing with his "rules" that neither he complies with or when he assumed that thousands of people, including children, were "evil" and I drown them that is the merciful being. 

			I have several theories that could be that being; one of them is that it is a childish being another is that it sees us just as you would see an ant farm and it really happens to us. 

			And let's not talk about its "rules" / Dictatorship where you kill 10 people and then at the moment you repent at the last second of your life and you will see a sign that says "Welcome to heaven". I will do that, but in a big way with all religions, who knows maybe I'm wrong and if there's a kind and peaceful being, if he exists then when I die, I'll have dinner with Hitler, Stan Lee and Alfred Hitchcock at the same time. 

			I mentioned being to refer to the term being all-powerful. And God as the almighty "leader" being of Catholicism. 

			I have not touched on the theme of the church and the cases of rape of children by priests undercover by the Church itself. It'll be available soon.

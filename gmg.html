			* I want to clarify that when referring to the weapon I mean not only
			weapons as pistols, but also weapons from spears to missiles. *
			Since the Stone Age, humans have been creating weapons intended
			to hunt and protect themselves from wild beasts. But, throughout
			history, humans have been using that tool to kill themselves, the
			clearest example being America with its school shootings since in
			2019 they had 22 dead and more than 19 wounded and this is not
			strange as this country is known for its rights to arms.
			And it's unbelievable that what separates me from a thief is a
			question in which he points out that he has no intention of killing.
			But of course it's better to blame video games for school shootings
			than to tell themselves that they have a very fat problem with guns,
			and don't get me wrong, I don't think we should ban guns much less,
			I think properly used weapons are very useful, but I think those who
			should use guns should be people like the police , since it is one thing
			to be against guns and another is to be stupid, weapons, whether
			you want it or not, are useful, because I do not expect a policeman to
			stop an unarmed heist and this is very important to take into
			account.
			We want to ban something without thinking about the consequences
			of that ban.

			I mean from the beginning that I totally support the equal, social and 
			economic right of each person without depending on whether it is
			woman, man, straight, homosexual, white, black, child or adult. Of
			course, everything has a certain limit because, focusing on the
			feminist movement, it is true that women have been valued
			inferiorly compared to men in history, but now that we have
			advanced as humanity and realized our mistake we have changed
			and that's why I support the feminist movement, but this has gone
			from your hands to a point that cannot be controlled , it began as an
			opportunity of a more united and egalitarian society and has ended
			up being an excuse for when something does not work for you, you
			are not caught for that job but if a man, chauvinism, a man looks at
			me, chauvinism, a man asks you for a romantic date, violation... At
			what point something that promised to change history has made it
			worse perhaps in false allegations or perhaps when the roles were
			changed, maybe before the man was above the woman socially and
			economically but now the positions are going to be changed. Maybe
			if the feminist movement worked, but it worked too much to the
			point that now companies are afraid to hire attractive women or at
			least women to save themselves potential allegations of workplace
			harassment, a thing that started out as a solution ended up being a
			problem. And here my question, how far would you go to be right?

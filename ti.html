			"The Enlightened of Bavaria", better known as "Iluminatis" translated
			from Latin means "Enlightened" was a secret organization created in
			the age of The Enlightenment, more specifically on May 1, 1776,
			which sought to oppose religious and government power, it is
			believed that several important figures of renown such as Adam
			Weishaupt, who was its founder , Carlos Theodore, Adolph von
			Knigge and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. With the help of the
			church, the government dissolved this organization in 1785. But he is
			said to have re-emerged to lead the French revolution.
			There are several conspiracies related to this organization, such as
			that they rule the world in secret, I see many flaws in these
			conspiracies, such as the fact that an organization, which is highly
			secret, should be impossible to know of its existence without
			belonging to that organization, as I mentioned in the title, is an open
			secret.
			I believe that for obvious reasons a person on foot should not be
			able to know of the existence of an organization which supposedly
			controls the world government.
			In my opinion, I love people's dedication to creating this kind of
			thing, I think this can be considered as making a fictional story, this
			becomes entertaining until it becomes an addiction and you start to
			say that the guy who served you a Whopper at McDonald's is a lizard.

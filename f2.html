		<h1>HOW FAR WOULD YOU GO FOR BEING RIGHT?: FEMINISTS <b><i>2</i></b></h1>
	</div>

		<p>
			As I said in the previous "How far you'd go for being right: Feminists 1" the
			feminist movement has changed to impressive levels to such an extent that it
			has changed to the foundations of the movement. But I tell this best in the first
			part, now I want to emphasize the involvement of man in the aforementioned
			fuckers and is that it is incredible that a movement that was made to create an
			egalitarianism between the two genres has ended up, ironically, being a motive
			that is separating men and women in two.
			Let us look at this in 2019 80,000 complaints
			<a target="__blank" href="https://www.rtve.es/noticias/20191125/51-asesinadas-43-huerfanos-mas80000-denuncias-dramaticas-cifras-violencia-genero-2019/1992281.shtml">, HERE</a>, as
			20% of the complaints had no evidence and only 2% have been shown to be
			false allegations, if we account for that 20% by taking away 5%, assuming they
			were true, we get 12,000 possible innocents who paid impressive fines or
			worse jail time.
			And this has a very simple explanation, the image you have of a man who goes
			after you at night is that he can rob you, kidnap, rape, etc. And the image you
			have of a woman walking behind you at night is doesn't have any of the points
			selected before. Why? Because it has been instilled that men only think of
			themselves, are aggressive and are bloodthirsty animals.
			And this obviously doesn't look anything like a man, in fact while feminists
			attack men, men know very well what's going on now, they realized when in a
			disco they told a girl a normal compliment, "I have to tell God that an angel has
			fallen off," that he would end up in a conversation and then in a date proposal
			and that in the end I end up in one more complaint.
			I think this will either have to be stopped or in 20 years I will have to go to
			court because my child asked a partner for the time. I sincerely recommend a
			channel called "Un TÃ­o Blanco Hetero" that talks about these issues in depth.

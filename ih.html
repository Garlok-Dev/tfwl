			There's nothing sadder than seeing the world shattered, but sadder
            is not seeing it.
            Sometimes, when I look at a can, I think about how it has come to my
            hand, everything that has come from the factory where it has been
            made to my custody, then I look at a person pulling that same can
            and you don't have to be a fortune teller to know that that can
            ended up being the cause of death of a turtle, a rat, a bird, a fish, etc.
            Because everything that the human being touches destroys it.
            Sometimes I wonder, what's the limit, if there is. Maybe it's when all
            the animals are extinct and only the human being is watching the
            world burn, but I know that even seeing all their faults exploding in
            their face, their pride wouldn't let them admit their mistakes.
            The human being and his pride, it is incredible to think that a being
            who prefers to die before damaging his pride has reached the moon
            without first killing himself.
            You don't have to be a genius to know there's no redemption for
            him.
            The human being has destroyed his home so much that I feel sorry
            that there are still people who try to ignore this trying to hide the
            dust under the carpet, making deaf ears to the cries of The Earth.

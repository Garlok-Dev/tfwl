			The official Cambridge dictionary defines hypocrisy as the act or
			state of pretending to be better than one is or to have feelings or
			beliefs which one does not actually have. It's hypocritical to
			demonstrate to close an abattoir and show up with Nike, it's
			hypocritical to say you have "Christmas pride" so as not to look bad
			when you get that PlayStation and it's hypocritical to be an animal
			activist while your dog is still locked in your flat, and we haven't even
			entered the hypocrisy of religion where they promote love and
			peace by leaving behind when they killed other people for not
			believing in their religion , be of different skin color or be considered
			a witch. Although I find it incredible that we consider ourselves a
			developed society when there are still religions that oppress people
			or that we kill each other in wars, this issue "I tell more deeply giving
			me a weapon and moving mountains of corpses(Soon...)"" That is why
			there is no hypocrisy in the world but that THE HYPOCRESIA IS THE
			WORLD...

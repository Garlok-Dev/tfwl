	<h1>HYPOCRISY IS THE WORLD.</h1>
	<p>
		The official Cambridge dictionary defines hypocrisy as the act or state of pretending to be better than one is or to have feelings or beliefs which one does not actually have. It's hypocritical to demonstrate to close an abattoir and show up with Nike, it's hypocritical to say you have "Christmas pride" so as not to look bad when you get that PlayStation and it's hypocritical to be an animal activist while your dog is still locked in your flat, and we haven't even entered the hypocrisy of religion where they promote love and peace by leaving behind when they killed other people for not believing in their religion , be of different skin color or be considered a witch. Although I find it incredible that we consider ourselves a developed society when there are still religions that oppress people or that we kill each other in wars, this issue I tell more deeply in [link] giving me a weapon and moving mountains of corpses[link]. That is why there is no hypocrisy in the world but that THE HYPOCRESIA IS THE WORLD...

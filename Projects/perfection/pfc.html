			The perfect term is a label normally used very poorly with regard to its meaning, since I think
            perfection is something abstract. A very simple example, let's imagine a row with an infinite number
            of people showing up at the same job, and there's another person interviewing each of those people
            to see who of them is PERFECT for that job, for convenience we'll call that person, who's
            interviewing that infinite number of people, Carl.
            Carl asked people, to report to that job, to have at least one IQ greater than 100, to speak 3
            languages or more and a college graduate plus extra skill.
            Poor Carl goes for person number 4,321, overwhelmed because each was better than the previous
            one, number 3,207 spoke seven languages, but 3,208 speaks eight.
            This problem that Carl is eating in the end has no solution, even if only five people had been
            presented will never have the PERFECT person for this position and is that it has no solution because
            perfection does not exist or rather is an illusion created by ourselves.
            I think the term perfection would be better used as a non-existent but motivating goal.

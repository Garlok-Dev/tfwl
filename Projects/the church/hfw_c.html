			I'm not going to lie to you, I've been wanting this for a long time
			since it's not hard to do, the church screwed up so many times that I
			wonder, why do they make deaf ears to the truth, it's going to be
			that they don't know or they don't want to know. And the truth is
			that they ignore the hundreds of cases of rape of minors by priests,
			priests, etc., ignore that their message of love did not serve the
			hundreds of women who burned for being supposed witches, and
			ignore that enclosing Galileo Galilei by saying that the earth is not
			flat does not give a very good image , the only plane here is his mind.
			Let's ignore this, let's not ignore everything, it's going to get angry
			and tomorrow it's burnt in a bonfire.
			We all know how ironic life is, it seems to laugh at us, because while
			"Safe the Children" or "UNICEF" struggles to get money hardly, the
			church has a whole country where they keep their mountains of
			gold.
			But now, even if they don't want to admit it, they're dying out and
			they know it. And I will see it as a flame that gradually goes out and is
			that they have made many mistakes which they will not be able to
			remedy, when they decide not to give all the gold they do not need
			to people who do need it, at that very moment will recognize that
			God exists and is good, but we all know that will not happen and at
			that moment we ignore that this will not change.

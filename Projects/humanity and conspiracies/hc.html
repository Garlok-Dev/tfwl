		<p>
			Humanity has a habit of answering questions it does not understand
			with surreal answers, this can be seen in ancient Greece that
			explained everything, such as the fall of rain, with gods.
			Now humanity has made enough progress to know that it doesn't
			take a being to explain a few things. Still, the human being has not
			lost that custom could give you hundreds of examples such as "The
			Loch Ness Monster", "Bigfoot", "Reptilians", "Iluminatis", etc.
			Or the famous alien of Area-51, I have responded that the possibility
			that there is currently such a being in that military base is basically
			unlikely and in the remote case that an extra-terrestrial life has
			visited this planet there would not be so many so-called "evidence"
			since a being who has enough technology to travel between galaxies
			will have enough knowledge to know that we are idiotic beings who
			would rather attack those beings and lose the possibility of bringing
			together civilizations to move humanity forward millions of years in
			technology.
			This can be checked in every series, book, movie, etc. We assume
			that these beings know the concept of hate. After all, the human
			being is a scorpion pointing at you with his sting and the slightest
			movement that the interpreter as an attack will inject you, without
			thinking, with the poison.
			I still have to talk about the supposed sect that controls the world,
			called "Iluminatis" but I want to dedicate its own category called
			"Iluminatis: A secret to voices" I will raise this with the other
			continuations soon...

		<p>
			Black humour is a category of humour that has "politically incorrect"
			humour such as racist, homophobic or sexist jokes.
			I'm not here to talk about black humour, but about what it causes in
			people, I honestly think there's a line that separates humour from
			insult, and this line is placed by every person in their opinion.
			I personally believe that I have that very well defined line I think that
			if it does not offend you is humour since humour defines you, an
			example, let's put a random person named James, let's say that he
			suffers from obesity, that person is one day with his friends and one
			proposes to make a career knowing that he did not accept because
			of his physical condition , that's black humour, now if James goes
			down the street and is compared to a whale, it's an insult, because
			even without offense, James has been affected.
			I love black humour, I think without the limitation of having to like
			everyone a joke can be very creative and fun, what you have to
			understand sometimes is that you can't constantly be offended by
			black humour as that's what you're looking for.
			It's like a bunch of blue pencils that all look the same to you, but all
			of a sudden you see a green pencil that does the same thing as a blue
			pencil, but it's different, so it's so flashy.
			When you start laughing at yourself, you'll love black humour.
